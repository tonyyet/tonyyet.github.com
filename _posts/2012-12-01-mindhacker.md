i just got this book called
[Mindhacker](http://www.ludism.org/mentat/Mindhacker) tonight, it looks really good... packed with real tools and
tips for mindhacking...

Mindhacker: 60 Tips, Tricks, and Games to Take Your Mind to the Next Level is
the unofficial sequel to MindPerformanceHacks, by RonHaleEvans and
MartyHaleEvans. The book follows the same basic outline as Mind Performance
Hacks, with chapters on Creativity, Memory, Math, and so on. However, all of the
hacks in these chapters are brand new.
