i noticed this from a [Google Tech Talk
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVhPk4aQmm4). [Mission Bicycle
Company](https://www.missionbicycle.com/) could be the coolest bike company in
San Fransisco now. They make premium urban bikes just for cycling in the city.
what's most inspiring about this company is that they have super customer
service, as could be reflected in [this
story](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2989-great-customer-service-from-the-mission-bicycle-company) of Jason Fred.
